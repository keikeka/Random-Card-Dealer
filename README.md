## Objective

The objective of this project is to put into practice everything learned in the DOM lessons and specifically how to change the styles of the website during runtime.

An algorithm was created that randomly generates a card at each update:
- Each time the Random Card button is pressed, a new random card is displayed.
- The displayed card has different possibilities between suit/pint: Hearts, Spades, Clubs and Diamonds.
- The card values are any of the following: 2 to 10, King, Queen, Jack or Ace (no joker).
Optionally, buttons were added to change the card to a different suit and suit and another button to change the card so that it is not repeated at any time.

## Application

1. Install the NPM packages: npm install
2. Run the project using: `node index.js`.
3. Â¡Push the buttons and check the results!

## Technologies

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
